# Linear Systems

When studying rigid motions, we'll find that everything can everything relies on being able to draw lines in particular directions and being able to find the intersection between lines.
These tasks can be accomplished with algebra, but we will do it purely geometrically by drawing the lines on grid paper.
To define a line, one needs two pieces of information.
1. A point from which the line will begin, and
2. A direction in which the line will extend (both forwards and backwards).

Picking an initial point is as simple as putting your pencil down on the paper, so most of this section will be devoted to how direction is handled.

## Vectors
If we only want to describe a direction, we could just use an angle.
Indeed, we could accomplish our goals with just angles, but translating angles to points on our grid paper would require introducing trigonometry.
Instead, we'll handle direction using **vectors**.
A **vector** is a mathematical object which records both a direction and a magnitude.
Vectors will prove useful when we're talking about translations.
Geometrically, vectors are represented by arrows.
